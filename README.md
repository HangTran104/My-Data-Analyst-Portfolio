This project uses Ho Chi Minh House dataset to:
<br>
- Survey house price of Ho Chi Minh city using data visualizations and descriptive statistics.
- <br>
- Build model to predict house price based on house features based on regression models.

<h3 style = 'color:black; text-align:left'>3. Super Market Food Analysis - Customers Segmentation Project</h3> 
Techniques: RFM and LRFMP coupled with KMeans Model for customers segmentation. Apriori for Association Rule Mining to determine the relationship between products. Pandas for Data cleaning and Explorary Data Analysis. Matplotlib and Seaborn for Visualization.
<br>
Customer segmentation and food supermarket analysis. This project use UK supermarket ecommerce dataset to clean data, perform EDA, build model for clustering supermarket customers into various groups with particular patterns. Business analysis the characteristics of these group to help the enterprise understand more about their customers and can plan appropriate marketing strategies.

<h3 style = 'color:black; text-align:left'>1. EDA process for Credit risk management Project</h3> 
To carry out this project, I download Credit Risk Dataset from Kaggle. The data is almost clean and ready for EDA processing. In the project, I try to visualize data and perform statistical analysis for the variables in different aspects such as univariable exploring, and multivariable exploring to decide which variable is the best choice for including in the input variable for prediction.

<h3 style = 'color:black; text-align:left'>2. Build model for Credit Risk prediction Project</h3>
Link: https://github.com/HangTran104/BUILD-MODELLER-FOR-CREDIT-RISK-ACCESSMENT
<br>
This project describes the whole process of building models for credit risk prediction after EDA. In the first stages of the process, I try to load data, transform and standardize data. In the second stage, I perform split data into train and test datasets. In the next stage, a demo RandomForestClassifier was carried out to evaluate the accuracy of datasets and survey the important roles of features in the dataset. Finally, various kinds of models was built and evaluated based on their accuracy and time of performance.
